# Research 

Most tools that exist for tracking diabetes, at least that i found, were for those who already have a diagnose.
I wanted to create an application to track symptoms in order to catch a pattern earlier rather than later. I mainly used
mayoclinic for information about symptoms and when to see the doctor. The Mayo clinic suggests seeing a doctor right when
you encounter symptoms. However there are always one off situations. That's why in this application I chose 7 consecutive
days of symptoms and 3 days of food and symptom correlation.
