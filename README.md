# Symptom Tracker

This is a fullstack application that tracks type 2 diabetes symptoms. The idea here is that this will help in starting 
conversations with your primary care physician if you consistently are experiencing symptoms. In addition to a 
conversation starter it will also help in behavior change by notifying you when a food you eat consistently causes symptoms.
